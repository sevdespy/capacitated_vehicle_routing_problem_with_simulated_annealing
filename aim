This project addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with multiple types of vehicles, each with varying costs and capacities. The Simulated Annealing Method is employed as a solution approach for this well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The CVRP involves the allocation of vehicles to a set of customers, considering capacity constraints and minimizing the total distance traveled. The project focuses on a specific scenario where a book seller in Ankara aims to distribute books to 8 different cities (Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Antalya, Konya, Adana, Samsun, Erzurum) while fulfilling demand, minimizing costs, and optimizing travel distance. Python is utilized for the implementation, with "distances.py" and "simulated_annealing.py" scripts. The former leverages the Bing Maps API to calculate driving distances between cities in Turkey. The latter generates the most efficient routes for each vehicle, considering the distance matrix, vehicles, demands, and optional parameters such as the number of iterations, cooling rate (alpha), and initial temperature. This project contributes to the development of effective and cost-efficient book distribution strategies applicable to similar contexts, providing valuable insights for vendors in this domain.
